# An Architectural Blueprint for High-Velocity, Accessibility-First Testing

## I. Strategic Framework: A Multi-Layered Approach to Accessible Testing

Achieving an **accessibility-first** testing strategy at high velocity requires
a test architecture that is both **fast** and **thorough**. Accessibility must
be embedded into everyday development without creating a slow feedback loop.
The proposed framework adopts a multi-layered approach: a rapid inner loop for
component tests and a comprehensive outer loop for end-to-end (E2E)
validation.

This architecture reflects recent tooling decisions. The framework leverages
the speed of the **Bun** runtime for most unit and integration tests, while a
parallel **Node.js** harness compensates for Bun's accessibility-scan
limitations. **Playwright** serves as the outer test loop that covers the full
user experience. Each layer has a distinct role, ensuring that accessibility is
verified at every stage without compromising developer productivity.

### 1.1 Deconstructing the Happy-DOM Deadlock: Bun vs. `axe-core`

Initial experiments exposed a fundamental deadlock between Bun's default DOM simulation and the industry-standard accessibility engine, **`axe-core`**. Bun’s test runner is engineered for extreme speed and recommends using **Happy DOM** for simulating the browser environment. **Happy DOM** is a lightweight, fast implementation of browser APIs – but its quest for speed comes at a cost. It diverges from web standards in subtle ways that clash with `axe-core`.

The most critical incompatibility lies in Happy DOM’s handling of the **`Node.isConnected`** property. This DOM API indicates if a node is attached to the document. `axe-core` relies on modifying `isConnected` during its DOM traversal. In Happy DOM, `isConnected` is implemented as a read-only property (and not fully standard), causing `axe-core` to throw runtime errors when it attempts to set it. In practice, this means any accessibility scan using `axe-core` fails outright under Happy DOM.[^1] Community reports and library documentation confirm this issue: the maintainers of `vitest-axe` (a Vitest/Jest integration for axe) explicitly warn that their matcher is **incompatible** with Happy DOM environments.

Unfortunately, Bun’s test runner **does not yet support** the more standards-compliant **JSDOM** environment (the de facto choice for Node-based DOM testing). JSDOM would solve the `isConnected` issue, but Bun cannot use it as a drop-in replacement at this time.[^2] This presents a catch-22:

- Bun’s recommended path for DOM tests is Happy DOM (for speed).

- `axe-core` cannot operate under Happy DOM due to fundamental API mismatch.

- The only viable alternative (JSDOM) isn’t supported in Bun’s native runner.

In summary, **Bun alone cannot run component-level accessibility scans**
today. This impasse is not a matter of configuration or minor bug; it is a
fundamental limitation of the current Bun + Happy DOM pairing. The strategy
must therefore retain Bun’s performance benefits *and* enable `axe-core` scans
through other means. The solution is a **hybrid testing approach**: run most
tests in Bun for speed, but outsource accessibility-specific tests to a
Node.js environment that supports JSDOM.

### 1.2 A Hybrid Solution: Node.js + JSDOM for A11y Scans

To resolve the deadlock, the framework introduces a **parallel Node.js test
harness** dedicated to accessibility checks. Rather than abandoning Bun
entirely, the `axe-core` scans are isolated into their own test suite running
on Node.js. In practice, this means writing accessibility tests in separate
files such as `*.a11y.test.tsx` and executing them with a Node-based runner
that uses JSDOM. All other unit and integration tests continue to run with
`bun test` using Happy DOM as usual.

Under this hybrid model, **Bun** remains the primary test engine for the vast
majority of tests, and **Node+JSDOM** is invoked as needed for the specific
cases that require `axe-core`. This dual setup provides the “best of both
worlds”:

- **Fast feedback for logic and UI structure:** Bun’s test runner with Happy
  DOM provides near-instant execution for tests that verify component behavior,
  state management, and basic rendering structure. Immediate feedback stays in
  the inner loop without waiting on a heavy browser simulation.

- **Standards-compliant DOM for accessibility rules:** A Node environment can
  host JSDOM, a more complete DOM implementation that `axe-core` supports. By
  running `axe` in this context, semantic and structural accessibility issues
  that Bun/Happy DOM would miss or error on can be caught.

To keep the Node-based tests efficient, the framework leverages **tsgo**
(TypeScript’s new fast compiler) to compile and launch these tests. A typical
setup could use a lightweight command such as `npx tsgo` to transpile the
`*.a11y.test.tsx` files on the fly and execute them in Node. This avoids the
overhead of a full Jest or Vitest context for the accessibility suite. These
a11y tests function as a specialized batch of scripts: they set up JSDOM,
render components, run `axe-core`, and report results.

Crucially, the separation of test files by naming convention means the two
suites can run independently. A typical workflow might include two NPM
scripts: one for the **fast tests** (`npm run test:unit` using Bun) and one
for the **a11y tests** (`npm run test:a11y` using Node). In continuous
integration, these can run in parallel or in sequence, but they remain
logically isolated. This prevents any slowdown of the primary suite; if
accessibility scans are a bit slower due to JSDOM’s overhead, they do not make
the core test run slower. It also provides flexibility: rapid prototyping can
rely on the Bun tests alone, with axe checks run when needed or in a
pre-commit hook.

By introducing a Node+JSDOM harness for `axe-core`, the accessibility-first
strategy is unblocked without sacrificing performance. Bun remains at the
center of testing, while a reliable secondary path performs **automated
accessibility audits** at the component level.

### 1.3 Acknowledging Limits: What JSDOM **Can’t** Catch

Even with JSDOM enabling `axe-core` scans, it’s important to set realistic expectations. **No simulated DOM environment (Happy DOM or JSDOM) can replace a real browser for certain accessibility validations.** JSDOM is purely a DOM parser and engine; it does **not** perform visual rendering, apply CSS layout, or run the browser’s accessibility tree computations. This means some accessibility rules are beyond its scope.

The official Axe documentation notes "limited support for JSDOM" and advises disabling rules that are known to yield false results in a headless DOM.[^3] The most prominent example is the **color contrast** rule. Verifying color contrast requires computing rendered text colors against background pixels – something impossible without an actual rendering engine (JSDOM has no concept of pixels or CSS cascade in effect). Any `axe-core` rule that depends on actual rendering or CSS will fail or produce irrelevant results under JSDOM. Besides `color-contrast`, other rules in this category include:

- **Target size** (minimum touch target dimensions)

- **Scrollable region focusable** (requires knowing if overflow renders scrollbars)

- **Visual focus indicators** (CSS outline or highlight on focusable elements)

- Etc.

The framework addresses this by **disabling such rules in the component-layer
tests** and deferring their verification to the Playwright E2E layer. In
practice, the Node-based axe test harness loads `axe-core` with a
configuration that turns off rules like `color-contrast` and any others that
rely on styles or layout. For example, `color-contrast` is disabled globally
in these tests and the documentation explicitly records that **contrast must be
checked in the browser**. Similarly, a rule like
`scrollable-region-focusable` is unreliable without actual CSS overflow
calculations; JSDOM scans should ignore it and a keyboard navigation test
should cover it in the E2E suite.

Understanding these limits reinforces the need for the **outer test loop**.
The inner loop (Bun + Node/axe tests) catches semantic issues such as missing
ARIA labels, improper roles, and missing alt text, but it **cannot fully
guarantee** things like proper color contrast, focus order on actual UI, or
dynamic content announcements. **Real browser testing with Playwright** covers
those gaps. This separation of concerns prevents a false sense of security
from the fast tests and makes it clear which checks occur later in the
pipeline.

With the strategic foundation laid, each layer of the architecture can now be
examined in turn: the fast feedback inner loop powered by Bun (augmented with
Node-based axe scans), and the comprehensive outer loop powered by Playwright.

## II. The Inner Loop: Fast, Accessible Component Testing with Bun & JSDOM

The “inner loop” is where developers spend most of their time. It encompasses
the rapid unit and component tests run during active development, often on
every file save or commit. The goal for this layer is to **make accessibility
a built-in aspect of these fast tests**. Accessibility checks should happen
automatically and with minimal overhead whenever a component’s logic or
rendering is tested.

To achieve this, the inner loop is structured into two synergistic parts:

- **2.1 Bun Test Runner + Happy DOM for Core Tests** – ultra-fast execution of component tests for logic, state, and basic rendering using Bun’s native test framework.

- **2.2 Node + JSDOM Axe Tests for Accessibility** – focused tests that specifically scan components with `axe-core` to catch semantic issues, running in a Node environment in parallel to the Bun tests.

- **2.3 Accessible-First Test Practices** – a set of conventions for writing
  tests (in both parts above) that ensure accessible selectors are used and
  assertions focus on meaningful output, effectively doubling as accessibility
  verification.

Together, these ensure that by the time a component leaves the inner loop, it
is not only functionally correct but also **accessible by design**.

### 2.1 Ultra-Fast Execution with Bun and Happy DOM

Bun’s built-in test runner serves as the default for all standard tests. The
`bun test` command is configured with Happy DOM as the global DOM
(`--preload ./tests/setup-happy-dom.ts` in the NPM script) so that each test
file can create `document` and `window` as if running in a browser. The
payoff is speed: Bun’s runtime and Happy DOM allow most tests to run in
**milliseconds**, keeping the feedback loop extremely tight.

These Bun-driven tests cover items such as:

- **Component Rendering and Props:** Does the component render the right output given certain props or state?

- **State Transitions:** Does the component update correctly when a user action
  is simulated or a context value changes?

- **Basic Accessibility attributes:** If a component is supposed to have certain ARIA attributes or roles, are they present in the rendered output?

For example, suppose a `<ThemeProvider>` context and the desktop
`<AppShell>` layout are under test. A Bun test might verify that when the
theme context is applied, the DOM gets a `data-theme` attribute on the
`<html>` element:

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from 'bun:test';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { act } from 'react';

// ... import the ThemeProvider and a test component

describe('ThemeProvider integration', () => {
  it('applies the default theme to <html> and <body>', () => {
    const container = document.createElement('div');
    document.body.appendChild(container);
    const root = createRoot(container);

    act(() => {
      root.render(<ThemeProvider><span id="probe" /></ThemeProvider>);
    });

    const probe = container.querySelector('#probe');
    expect(probe).toBeTruthy();
    // Check that the theme data attribute was applied globally
    expect(document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme')).toBe('wildside-night');
    expect(document.body.getAttribute('data-theme')).toBe('wildside-night');

    root.unmount();
  });
});
```

In this snippet, the Bun test quickly sets up a React root in a fake DOM, renders a component, and makes assertions. The usage of `document.querySelector` and standard DOM APIs is possible thanks to Happy DOM. Tests like this run blazingly fast (no real browser, no JSDOM overhead) and can be run hundreds of times a minute during development.

**Happy DOM Caveat:** As discussed, Happy DOM isn’t fully standards-compliant.
Its usage should be **limited to tests that do not require full fidelity**.
That typically means avoiding deep CSS or canvas-related testing here. For
most React component output and event simulation, Happy DOM is sufficient and
incredibly fast. Whenever a limitation appears, such as an API not implemented
or a discrepancy, it should be documented. In many cases, simple polyfills or
slight test adjustments can work around minor differences.

### 2.2 Automated Accessibility Scans via Node + JSDOM

To complement Bun’s lightning-fast tests, a parallel suite of
**accessibility-focused tests** runs in Node. These tests are responsible for
running `axe-core` against components. They ensure that, from a semantic
standpoint, components meet WCAG guidelines before integration into pages.

**Test Structure and Naming:** These files are suffixed with `.a11y.test.tsx`
(for example, `Button.a11y.test.tsx`, `Modal.a11y.test.tsx`) to clearly
distinguish them. This naming serves two purposes: it signals their purpose,
and it allows targeted execution in test scripts. Package scripts can be
configured so that `npm run test:a11y` only picks up files matching
`*.a11y.test.tsx`. In CI, this makes it trivial to run the accessibility suite
separately from, and possibly in parallel with, the main Bun test suite.

**JSDOM Setup:** Each a11y test file uses **JSDOM** as its DOM environment.
JSDOM can either be initialized manually within the test, or supplied by a
Node test runner that supports it globally. One lightweight approach is a
small harness script that, for each `.a11y.test.tsx` file:

- Spins up a JSDOM instance (e.g. using `new JSDOM('<!DOCTYPE html><html><body></body></html>')` and setting global `window` and `document`).

- Mounts the React component into that JSDOM document (likely using ReactDOM or Testing Library’s `render`).

- Runs `axe-core` on the JSDOM’s DOM tree.

- Asserts that there are no violations.

This can be automated using familiar libraries. For instance, **React Testing
Library** can render components into the JSDOM document, and the **axe-core
API** (via something like `jest-axe` or `vitest-axe` utilities) can perform
the scan. The following illustrates a typical pattern, written in a
Jest/Vitest style similar to what a custom harness would do:

```tsx
// Button.a11y.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
import Button from './Button';

// Extend expect for the axe matcher (if using jest-axe)
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('Button has no accessibility violations and is properly labelled', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);

  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();  // Custom matcher asserts zero axe issues

  // Also verify accessible name and role are correct as a sanity check:
  const btn = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i });
  expect(btn).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

In this example, when run in a Node+JSDOM environment, the `Button` component
is rendered off-screen and scanned. The test will fail if, for instance, the
`<Button>` component is missing an accessible name or has ARIA attributes
misused. By including a Testing Library query
(`getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i })`), the test verifies not only
that the component is *free of axe-detectable violations* but also that it
adheres to expected accessibility APIs.

This pattern applies to all interactive components. A more complex example is
a **Modal** component which might be hidden or shown based on props:

```tsx
// Modal.a11y.test.tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';
import Modal from './Modal';

describe('Modal component accessibility', () => {
  test('has no violations when closed', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Modal open={false} title="Sample Modal" />);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
    // Even though the modal is closed (perhaps rendered off-screen or not at all),
    // no stray violations such as missing landmarks should remain.
  });

  test('has no violations when open', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Modal open={true} title="Sample Modal"><p>Content</p></Modal>);
    // Temporarily disable a page-level rule that is irrelevant in isolation:
    const results = await axe(container, {
      rules: {
        region: { enabled: false }  // disable landmark rule since modal isn't wrapped in <main> here
      }
    });
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
});
```

The second test demonstrates **contextual rule configuration**: the `region`
rule is not applicable when testing a Modal in isolation, so it is disabled.
This ability to tweak axe’s rules per test helps avoid false positives and
keeps the test signal clean. Every axe violation reported in this suite should
correspond to a genuine issue that a user might encounter.

**Execution and Performance:** Running these Node/JSDOM tests is slower than
the Bun tests, because JSDOM startup and axe analysis take time, but they are
still relatively fast. A simple component scan might take on the order of tens
of milliseconds to a couple hundred milliseconds. Performance concerns are
mitigated by running these tests in parallel and by keeping each test focused
on a single component or state to avoid heavy DOMs. In CI, further
parallelization is possible by splitting the accessibility tests across
multiple machines if needed.

The key outcome of this inner-loop accessibility suite is **immediate feedback
on semantic issues**. If a component is missing an `aria-label` on a button, a
test fails immediately. That is far better than catching the issue days later
in a manual audit or in a slow E2E test. It turns accessibility into a daily
concern rather than a QA afterthought.

### 2.3 Accessible-First Test Practices: Enforcing Good Habits

Having the right tools is only half the battle. The framework also enforces
**strict conventions in how tests are written**, ensuring that the test code
itself encourages accessible implementation. Two key practices are:

- **Use of Accessible Queries:** Tests must interact with the rendered DOM the
  same way a user or assistive technology would, by using accessible labels,
  roles, and text content. Selecting elements by obscure hooks or internal IDs
  is forbidden whenever a semantic alternative exists. In practice, this means
  favoring Testing Library queries like `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, or
  `getByText` over queries like `querySelector('[data-testid="..."]')`. If
  tests cannot find an element by a meaningful label or role, that is a red
  flag that the component might not be accessible.

*Policy:* The use of `data-testid` (or similar testing-only attributes) is
considered a last resort. In code review, any test that uses a test ID must
justify why a role or label could not be used instead. Often, the remedy is to
improve the component (e.g. add an `aria-label` or proper text) so that a more
user-centric query becomes possible. This policy creates a virtuous cycle: it
pushes developers to build components with accessibility in mind, and it makes
the tests more robust by tying them to user-visible strings and roles.

*Automation:* Biome loads the `tools/grit/rule-testing-*.grit` patterns, which emit the
`test/no-testid-selectors`, `test/no-queryselector`,
`test/prefer-byrole-for-actions`, and `test/no-raw-dom-lookup` diagnostics for
test files. These rules error on any `*ByTestId` lookup (or raw
`querySelector*`), warn when `getByText` is clicked, and therefore keep tests
aligned with the role-first guidance from Testing Library and
Playwright. If a semantic selector is genuinely impossible, add an
`ACCESSIBILITY:` justification next to a targeted
`// biome-ignore lint/test/no-testid-selectors` suppression so reviewers can
see the trade-off.

*Example:* In the `HeaderBar` component test, instead of selecting a theme
button by an ID or class, query it by its accessible name:

```tsx
const dayThemeButton = screen.getByRole("button", {
  name: "Day",
});
expect(dayThemeButton).toBeInTheDocument();
```

This example relies on the visible label on the theme button. If that label
were missing or changed, the test would fail, which is desirable because the
accessible contract of the UI would have changed. Either way, the test asserts
something a screen reader user would care about: that there is a button with
that label.

#### 2.3.1 Exemplars awaiting refactor

There are still a handful of high-visibility suites leaning on test IDs and
DOM structure hooks. They are valuable targets when socializing the upcoming
lint rule:

- `tests/routes.stage1.test.tsx` (quick-map and offline manager flows) uses
  selectors such as `[data-testid='quick-walk-stops-panel']` and
  `offline-delete-button`. The fix is to surface accessible names – for
  example, ensure the stops tab owns an `aria-labelledby`, label the delete
  buttons “Delete {map name}”, and then switch the tests to
  `getByRole('tabpanel', { name: /stops/i })` or
  `getAllByRole('button', { name: /delete .* offline map/i })`.
- `tests/header-bar.test.tsx` should continue asserting theme state through
  the real controls, for example by checking the active button’s
  `aria-pressed` state rather than a DOM-only hook.
- `tests/quick-map-fragment.test.tsx` queries map panels via
  `[data-testid='quick-walk-map-container']`. Once the container has a sensible
  label (for example `aria-label="Quick walk map"`), the test can use
  `getByRole('region', { name: /quick walk map/i })` and remain resilient.

Documenting these specific call sites gives reviewers a short list of “fix me
next” examples and shows what the accessible alternative should look like.

- **Assertions on Accessibility Outcomes:** In addition to low-level
  assertions such as “this state toggled” or “this element exists”, tests
  should add assertions specifically for accessibility expectations. For
  instance, after clicking a button that opens a modal, a test might assert
  that focus moved to the modal dialog element (using
  `expect(dialog).toHaveFocus()` or checking `document.activeElement`). Or
  after toggling a theme, a test can assert that the `<html lang>` or
  `data-theme` attributes are correctly set. Writing these into tests ensures
  that accessibility features such as focus management, ARIA attributes, and
  language attributes are not accidentally broken.

To enforce these practices, the framework integrates ESLint rules and testing
guidelines:

- **ESLint plugins** such as Testing Library’s `prefer-user-event` and
  `prefer-accessible-queries` should be enabled to warn if a test uses
  `getByTestId` when a role query is available, or if it calls low-level DOM
  methods instead of simulating real user events.

- In pull request reviews, the team should flag any test code that does not
  adhere to accessible-first querying. Over time this becomes second nature.

By combining tooling (axe scans, proper libraries) with conventions (only use
accessible queries, assert on ARIA/focus behaviors), the inner loop becomes a
strong quality gate. A component that is functionally perfect but accessibly
flawed cannot pass unnoticed.

## III. The Outer Loop: Comprehensive E2E Validation with Playwright

While the inner loop verifies individual components in isolation, the
**outer loop** ensures that the application works as a cohesive, accessible
whole. **Playwright** runs end-to-end tests in real browsers. The outer loop
addresses everything that a simulated environment cannot: actual rendering,
styling, user interactions across components, and integration of features like
routing and dynamic content. It is the final safety net and a place to conduct
more intensive audits, including visual and internationalization checks.

Playwright was chosen for its robust multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox,
WebKit), its powerful automation APIs, and built-in test runner that
integrates assertions, parallelization, and rich reporting. This section
outlines how Playwright supports various accessibility-focused E2E tasks:

- **3.1 In-Browser Axe Scans:** Running `axe-core` in a **real browser** context to catch issues like color contrast, focus order, and other things JSDOM can’t detect.

- **3.2 Advanced Interaction Tests:** Simulating keyboard navigation, verifying focus management (e.g., modals trapping focus, return focus on close), and other workflow-oriented checks.

- **3.3 Accessibility Tree Snapshots:** Capturing and diffing the browser’s accessibility tree to detect unintended semantic changes over time.

- **3.4 Visual Regression across Viewports/Themes:** Taking screenshots of pages/components in various layouts to catch visual bugs that could affect usability or clarity.

- **3.5 Localization and Language Verification:** Testing the app under different locale settings to ensure language-specific attributes and content appear correctly.

This battery of tests runs less frequently (e.g., on pull request or nightly builds) due to being heavier, but it is exhaustive in ensuring real-world accessibility compliance.

### 3.1 Strategic Axe Scans in the Browser

`axe-core` is integrated into Playwright tests via the `@axe-core/playwright`
utility. This allows the axe script to be injected into pages and the rendered
output to be analyzed for violations. The **advantage** is that, in a real
browser, axe can evaluate everything, including CSS, canvas, and the actual
computed tree.

However, the suite must be kept fast. Running a full axe scan after every
action would turn E2E tests into a slog. Instead, accessibility scans are
treated as **targeted assertions** at critical checkpoints of a user flow:

- **After initial page load:** The fully loaded page is often scanned to ensure
  no glaring issues exist on the baseline UI.

- **After major UI transitions:** For example, after opening a modal, after navigating to a new page, after triggering a form validation that reveals errors, etc. These are points where new content appears or state significantly changes, warranting a re-check.

- **Scope the scan to changed regions:** Using
  `AxeBuilder.include(selector)`, analysis can be limited to specific parts of
  the DOM. For instance, after opening a modal, scanning *only* the modal
  dialog element saves time and focuses results.

**Example – Modal Workflow:** Consider a test of an e-commerce flow where
clicking "Add to Cart" opens a dialog. The test can be written as follows:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { AxeBuilder } from '@axe-core/playwright';

test.describe('Add to Cart Modal Flow', () => {
  test('main page has no axe violations on load', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/products');
    const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
    expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);
  });

  test('modal dialog is accessible after opening', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/products');
    // Trigger the modal
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' }).click();
    // Ensure modal is visible
    const modal = page.locator('#add-to-cart-modal');
    await expect(modal).toBeVisible();
    // Run axe only inside the modal
    const modalResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).include('#add-to-cart-modal').analyze();
    expect(modalResults.violations).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

In this snippet, the first test scans the full page and expects zero
violations, meaning the base page structure is sound. The second test
specifically clicks the "Add to Cart" button and then waits for the modal. The
scan is limited to the modal content. If the modal were missing an `aria-label`
on its header or had a form control without a label, `axe-core` would catch it
here.

By **scoping axe scans and using them sparingly**, performance impact is kept
under control. Each scan might take a second or two on a large page, so scans
should occur only where they yield new information. The principle is:
**treat accessibility scans as assertions, not as a blanket afterthought**.
This keeps the E2E tests fast enough for CI while still covering critical
scenarios.

### 3.2 Interactive Behavior and Focus Management

Automated accessibility testing must extend beyond static analysis. Many
accessibility issues are only apparent when users actually interact with the
UI. With Playwright’s control of the browser, those interactions can be
simulated and the application’s response can be validated. Two major focus
areas are **keyboard navigation** and **focus handling**.

#### 3.2.1 Keyboard Navigation Flow Tests

A core WCAG principle is that **all functionality should be operable via
keyboard**. E2E tests should mimic a user pressing `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`,
`Enter`, and `Escape` to navigate and activate components.

For example, consider verifying the navigation menu and search input in a header:

```ts
test('Home page header is fully keyboard-navigable', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  // Press Tab repeatedly and check focus moves in the expected order
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  let focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.textContent);
  expect(focused).toMatch(/Products/i);  // focus on "Products" link

  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.getAttribute('aria-label'));
  expect(focused).toBe('Search');  // now search box is focused (identified by its aria-label)

  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.textContent);
  expect(focused).toMatch(/My Account/i);  // now "My Account" button is focused

  // Reverse navigation
  await page.keyboard.down('Shift');
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  await page.keyboard.up('Shift');
  focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.getAttribute('aria-label'));
  expect(focused).toBe('Search');
});
```

This script tabs through the interactive elements of the header and uses
`document.activeElement` to check which element is currently focused. It
verifies that focus cycles through **Products link → Search input → My Account
button** in order, and that it can go backwards as well. If an element is not
reachable via Tab, the test will catch it.

Similar tests apply to menus, dialogs, and other composite components:

- Ensuring that pressing **Enter** on a focused button triggers the expected action (Playwright’s `page.keyboard.press('Enter')` can be used).

- Ensuring **Escape** closes dialogs or dropdowns when focused inside them.

- Verifying there are no **keyboard traps**: focus should never get stuck in a
  loop or lost off-screen. For modals, focus should remain trapped within the
  modal while it is open, but when the modal closes, focus should return to a
  sensible place.

These tests provide confidence that a sighted keyboard user or a visually
impaired user using keyboard plus screen reader can navigate and operate the
application fully.

#### 3.2.2 Focus Handling in Dialogs and Overlays

Building on keyboard tests, **modal dialogs, popovers, and other overlays**
should be checked specifically for proper focus management:

- When a modal opens, the first interactive element inside it should receive focus (or the modal container itself, if it has `tabindex="-1"` to catch focus).

- Tab should wrap within the modal (since modals typically trap focus until closed).

- When the modal closes, focus should restore to the element that opened it (or another logical location).

Playwright makes it straightforward to test these conditions:

```ts
// Assume the "Add to Cart" modal from earlier tests
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' }).click();
const modalDialog = page.locator('#add-to-cart-modal');
await expect(modalDialog).toBeVisible();

// The first focusable element in modal should be focused.
const firstFocusable = modalDialog.locator('button').first();
await expect(firstFocusable).toBeFocused();

// Press Tab repeatedly within modal and ensure focus stays in modal
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  const activeId = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.closest('#add-to-cart-modal')?.id);
  expect(activeId).toBe('add-to-cart-modal');
}

// Close modal (press Escape or click close button)
await page.keyboard.press('Escape');
await expect(modalDialog).toBeHidden();

// After closing, focus should return to the "Add to Cart" button
const triggerButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' });
await expect(triggerButton).toBeFocused();
```

This sequence rigorously checks focus containment and restoration. If any step
fails, it indicates a bug in the focus management logic, perhaps a missing
call to `.focus()` or incorrect `tabindex` attributes.

Such tests ensure **operability** – one of the four principles of
accessibility (POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust). They
catch issues that static analysis never could (for example, `axe-core` may
not report that focus was lost when a dialog closed).

### 3.3 Accessibility Tree Snapshots for Semantic Regression

In a complex UI, it is possible to inadvertently change or break semantic
structure while refactoring, even if everything “looks” fine visually. To
guard against this, the framework uses **accessibility tree snapshots** in
Playwright. The accessibility tree is what assistive technologies actually
interact with a computed structure derived from the DOM, listing elements
with roles, names, and properties as a screen reader would perceive them.

Playwright provides an API `page.accessibility.snapshot()` that returns this
tree. The adopted pattern is to take **snapshot files** (in a serialized
format like JSON or YAML) of key components or pages, and then use a custom
matcher to compare future runs against the baseline. This is analogous to
visual snapshot testing, but for semantics.

A custom Expect matcher (e.g., `toMatchAriaSnapshot()`) simplifies this. The
first time a test runs, it generates a snapshot file (for example,
`product-card.spec.ts-snapshots/product-card-accessibility.yml`). Subsequent
runs diff the current accessibility tree against that file and fail the test
if there is any difference, except for whitelisted changes.

**Example – Product Card Component:**

```ts
test('ProductCard maintains accessible structure', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/products/widget-pro');
  const card = page.locator('.product-card');
  // Expect the accessibility tree of the product card to match the stored baseline
  await expect(card).toMatchAriaSnapshot();
});
```

On first run, `toMatchAriaSnapshot()` will save something like:

```yaml
role: 'group'
name: 'Widget Pro'
children:
  - role: 'image'
    name: 'Widget Pro product image'
  - role: 'heading'
    name: 'Widget Pro'
    level: 2
  - role: 'paragraph'
    name: '$19.99'
  - role: 'button'
    name: 'Add to Cart'
```

(This is a conceptual illustration of what the accessibility snapshot might contain.)

If a developer accidentally changed the `h2` in `ProductCard` to an `h3` or removed an aria-label on the image, the next test run would produce a different snapshot and cause a failure. This kind of regression test is **highly sensitive to meaningful changes** but **robust to cosmetic ones**. Unlike raw HTML snapshots (which would break on any minor markup change), the accessibility snapshot ignores irrelevant container `<div>`s or styling hooks and focuses purely on roles, names, and structure. If an extra `<div>` is added for layout but doesn’t affect roles or names, the snapshot remains the same. But if, say, a heading level changes or a label is lost, the difference is caught immediately.

This technique helps ensure that refactors or component iterations do not
silently alter the accessible experience. It is especially useful for ensuring
things like:

- Headings hierarchy remains correct (no suddenly skipping from h2 to h4, etc.).

- Buttons and links retain their names.

- Images keep their alt text or accessible name.

- Regions and landmarks (like nav, main, footer) remain in place.

Accessibility snapshot tests should be incorporated for all major composite
components and pages. They serve as a guardrail for semantic consistency.

### 3.4 Visual Regression Testing across Breakpoints and Themes

Accessibility is not just about screen readers and keyboard navigation; visual
presentation matters too. Issues like text getting cut off, color contrast in
different themes, or layout breakage on small screens can dramatically affect
usability. To catch these, the framework includes **visual regression tests**
in the Playwright suite.

Using Playwright’s screenshot capabilities, snapshots of pages or components
can be generated under various conditions and compared to baselines. Key
dimensions include:

- **Different screen sizes (responsive breakpoints):** Layouts should be
  tested on a small mobile viewport (e.g. 375×667) vs a desktop viewport
  (e.g. 1280×800). This ensures the responsive design does not introduce
  inaccessible overflow or content hiding on small screens.

- **Light and Dark themes:** Since the application supports theme switching
  (e.g., `wildside-day` vs `wildside-night` themes), each mode should be
  captured in screenshots. This helps verify color contrast in each theme and
  catches theme-specific asset issues.

- **Critical pages/components:** Focus should remain on pages like the home
  dashboard, forms, and any component with complex styling (e.g., data
  visualization or maps in this context) for visual snapshots.

**Example – Responsive Header Snapshot:**

```ts
test.describe('Header visual regression', () => {
  // Test at two breakpoints
  const viewports = { mobile: { width: 360, height: 740 }, desktop: { width: 1280, height: 800 } };
  for (const [label, size] of Object.entries(viewports)) {
    test(`header looks correct in ${label} view`, async ({ page }) => {
      await page.setViewportSize(size);
      await page.goto('/');  // go to homepage which includes the header
      // If theme defaults to dark, ensure it’s set for consistency
      await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(`header-${label}.png`);
    });
  }
});
```

The first run will save `header-mobile.png` and `header-desktop.png`.
Subsequent runs will compare screenshots pixel-by-pixel. If a CSS change
accidentally pushes the header’s menu off-screen on mobile, the diff will flag
it. The usual challenges of visual testing remain, such as ensuring consistent
fonts and ignoring dynamic content, but Playwright includes mechanisms for
that.

For theme variations, a test might explicitly toggle the theme:

```ts
test('Settings panel visual regression in dark and light mode', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/settings');
  // Dark theme (default)
  await expect(page.locator('#settings-panel')).toHaveScreenshot('settings-dark.png');
  // Toggle theme button
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Switch to light theme' }).click();
  await expect(page.locator('#settings-panel')).toHaveScreenshot('settings-light.png');
});
```

Baseline images are now available for both dark and light modes of the
settings panel. If some text becomes illegible in light mode, the screenshot
difference will reveal it. This effectively acts as an automated
**contrast check** across themes, complementing what axe does.

Visual regression tests are run sparingly because they can be
resource-intensive and occasionally flaky. Flakiness is mitigated by:

- Freezing dynamic data (e.g., use test accounts or stubbed dates so that
  today’s date or random data does not spoil the snapshot).

- Using tolerances or masking for known nondeterministic regions if needed.

- Running on consistent infrastructure (same browser versions, etc., via Playwright’s Docker or the cloud workers).

The payoff is worthwhile: the UI can be verified to look as intended and
remain usable at a glance. Many accessibility issues manifest visually, so
these tests catch problems that neither axe nor unit tests would.

### 3.5 Localization and Internationalization Checks

Finally, accessibility extends to supporting users from different locales and
languages. An often overlooked aspect is ensuring that the application handles
localization correctly, both in terms of content and technical attributes like
the page’s language. E2E tests validate internationalization (i18n) features:

- **Locale-specific content loading:** If the application is translated or
  supports multiple languages, switching to a locale should yield the correct
  text.

- **Language attributes:** The `<html lang="">` attribute should be set
  correctly whenever the locale changes, and any region-specific sub-tags
  should be handled if needed. The `lang` attribute is critical for screen
  readers to switch voice profiles.

- **Directionality:** If right-to-left (RTL) languages are supported, tests
  should verify that the `dir="rtl"` attribute is applied and that layout
  flips appropriately.

Playwright allows different locales to be simulated by launching contexts with
a specific locale. For example, `browser.newContext({ locale: 'fr-FR' })`
would make `navigator.language` report French. Alternatively, if the
application has a UI control for language, that control can be used.

**Example – Language Toggle:**

```ts
test('app supports English and Spanish locales', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  // Default is English
  expect(await page.locator('html').getAttribute('lang')).toBe('en');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Welcome' })).toBeVisible();

  // Switch locale via UI control (assuming a button or menu)
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Español' }).click();
  // Now the page should be in Spanish
  expect(await page.locator('html').getAttribute('lang')).toBe('es');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Bienvenido' })).toBeVisible();
});
```

This test verifies two things: the `<html lang>` attribute changes from "en"
to "es", and the content of a heading changes from "Welcome" to "Bienvenido".
If either fails, it indicates a localization issue.

For more thorough coverage, an entire suite can run in a non-default locale
using Playwright’s test config. For instance, some critical E2E tests can be
duplicated under a fixture where the context is launched with
`{ locale: 'es-ES' }`. That way, the locale toggle is not the only path under
test; the Spanish version of various flows can also be checked for axe
violations and parity with English behavior.

By treating localization as a first-class aspect of testing, the
**understandability** aspect of accessibility is safeguarded for all supported
audiences. There is also a practical benefit: missing translation keys or
formatting issues are caught early.

## IV. Performance Strategy and CI Integration

Having a comprehensive test suite is valuable, but it must run efficiently to
be viable in a fast-paced development setting. The strategy layers the tests
so that the cheapest tests **fail fast** and the heavier tests are deferred to
later, possibly parallelized, stages. These layers are also integrated into
the Continuous Integration pipeline so that accessibility is continuously
enforced.

### 4.1 Layered Test Execution for Speed

The test architecture naturally splits into tiers that can execute
separately:

- **Layer 1: Bun Unit/Integration Tests** – Extremely fast, and suitable for
  every commit or even every file change in watch mode. These catch basic
  regressions immediately. If any of these fail, there is no need to proceed
  further until fixed.

- **Layer 2: Node/JSDOM Axe Tests** – Slightly slower, but still relatively
  quick. They can run in parallel to Layer 1. In a local development flow,
  they may not run on every save, but they should run before pushing code. In
  CI, they run on each PR. If an accessibility rule fails here, the build
  fails for serious issues or at least flags the problem for fixing.

- **Layer 3: Playwright E2E Tests** – The slowest layer, involving real
  browsers and possibly multiple iterations (various viewports, etc.). This
  layer runs less frequently, typically on pull request validation and nightly
  full runs. Within this layer, Playwright can be configured to shard tests
  across multiple workers. Even though each test is heavy, the suite can still
  complete in a reasonable time.

In CI, parallel jobs provide the best throughput:

- The **Bun tests** run in one job. Given Bun’s speed, this job might finish
  in, say, 30 seconds.

- The **axe a11y tests** run simultaneously in another job. This might also
  take on the order of seconds to a minute, depending on how many components
  are scanned.

- The **Playwright E2E tests** run in parallel in another job. This could take
  a few minutes, especially if running on three browsers or doing visual
  comparisons, but Playwright can often keep it around 2-5 minutes by
  parallelizing internally.

By splitting these, the overall CI time is roughly the maximum of these, not
the sum. The **longest** will usually be the Playwright job. If that job takes
four minutes and the others finish in one minute, the total CI test time
remains roughly four minutes. This is acceptable for a PR gate in exchange for
the thorough coverage provided.

GitHub Actions, or an equivalent CI system, should reflect this structure:

- Job “Test: Bun” – runs `bun test` on all non-a11y tests.

- Job “Test: Accessibility (Node)” – runs the Node script for axe tests.

- Job “Test: E2E” – runs `npx playwright test` (possibly with some flags for trace or report).

- An overall workflow depends on all three finishing. Fail-fast can be set for
  certain jobs if desired.

This way, a quick failure such as a unit test or basic axe rule failure does
not require waiting for the whole E2E suite to complete. Immediate feedback is
available on what broke.

Additionally, if test runtime becomes a concern, those tests can be partitioned
further. For example, axe tests can run in parallel shards. At the current
scope, that likely is not necessary.

### 4.2 CI Reporting and Failure Triage

Integrating into CI also means handling results smartly. Any
**accessibility violation of high severity** should be treated as a build
failure. For instance:

- If axe reports a **critical or serious** violation in either the component
  tests or E2E scans, the CI job fails. This prevents merging code that would
  introduce major accessibility regressions.

- **Minor** or **moderate** issues may be allowed to pass but logged,
  depending on the chosen strictness level, with an automated task created to
  fix them. In practice, the inner loop should catch most issues early, so few
  if any moderate issues should remain by the time E2E runs.

Playwright and the Node test harness can output machine-readable results (such
as JSON). A post-processing step in CI can parse the axe results and summarize
any violations. The framework also generates **HTML reports** for easier
debugging:

- The Node axe tests can produce an HTML report of all violations, with links to relevant DOM nodes and suggestions (using the output from `axe-core`).

- Playwright, by default, can produce an HTML report that includes screenshots,
  failing test traces, and related diagnostics. Enable it and upload it as a
  CI artifact on failure.

The resulting workflow is straightforward: if a test fails, especially an
accessibility one, the report artifact can be downloaded to inspect the exact
failure. A Playwright trace may show that focus did not move as expected after
clicking a button, whilst an axe report may highlight a missing form label.

Finally, the process should maintain a **culture of accessibility ownership**.
Failing tests are not made green by updating the tests alone; the expectation
is to *fix the underlying issue*. Because the tests are designed to catch real
problems, the correct response to a failure is usually to correct the component
or page (for example, add the missing `aria-label`, adjust the colour contrast
in CSS, or fix the focus logic in JavaScript).

Severity tagging helps manage this process:

- Tests or checks can be annotated with severity levels (for example, using
  axe’s impact ratings). A CI parser can distinguish them and, if needed, post
  a PR comment such as: “Accessibility issue detected: **low contrast on button
  text** (critical). This must be resolved before merge.”

- For less critical issues that slip through, backlog tickets can be created
  automatically. Ideally, the gating ensures that everything important is
  caught and fixed in the same development cycle.

## V. Synthesis and Implementation Roadmap

The proposed testing framework delivers a **holistic, layered approach** to
accessibility testing without sacrificing development speed. Fast
component-level checks combine with full browser validation so that every new
UI element is both **rapidly verified** and **truly accessible** in practice.
Below is a summary of the two major layers and their roles:

| Dimension | Component Layer (Bun + Node/JSDOM) | E2E Layer (Playwright) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Tools | Bun test runner (Happy DOM) for units; Node + JSDOM for axe scans | Playwright test runner (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with Axe |
| Environment | Simulated DOM (Happy DOM for speed; JSDOM for standards) | Real browser environment (headless or headed as needed) |
| Scope of Tests | Isolated components and small integration pieces in memory | Full pages and user flows in the deployed app context |
| Execution Speed | Very fast (milliseconds per test file under Bun; a bit more for axe) | Slower (seconds per test, overall minutes per suite) |
| Defects Caught | **Structural/Semantic issues:** missing labels, incorrect roles, improper ARIA, form associations, and basic functional bugs in components. *(Visual/style issues generally are not caught here due to Happy DOM/JSDOM limits.)* | **Visual & Interactive issues:** colour-contrast failures, element focus order, keyboard traps, missing focus outlines, responsive layout breakages, incorrect `lang` attributes, integration issues, and end-to-end flows such as modals and navigation. |
| When to Run | On every code change or commit (developer inner loop); each PR as a quick check | On each PR merge request (CI gating) and nightly full runs; also useful locally before major releases |
| CI Role | Fast feedback that fails the build quickly if a core test or axe rule fails, preventing bad code early | Final quality gate that ensures the merged product is accessible in reality and produces review artifacts such as screenshots and traces |

This model ensures **accessibility is woven into every stage**: immediate IDE
or terminal feedback catches obvious issues, and CI catches anything that
requires a real browser to detect.

### 5.1 Implementation Plan

To adopt this framework, a phased rollout is advisable:

#### Phase 1: Setup Bun and Basic Testing (Day 0-1)

- **Install/Verify Bun** in the project. Ensure the `bun:test` script is working with Happy DOM. Add a `tests/setup-happy-dom.ts` to configure any globals or polyfills (for example, setting `document.doctype` if needed, or configuring `window.fetch` if used in tests).

- **Establish Test Structure:** Decide on a directory convention (e.g., all tests in `tests/` folder, mirroring src structure). Ensure naming for a11y tests is in place (e.g., `*.a11y.test.tsx`).

- **Sample Bun Tests:** Write a couple of simple Bun tests for existing components to validate that the framework is running and fast. For example, test a context provider or a presentational component. This lays groundwork and confidence in Bun’s runner.

#### Phase 2: Integrate Node A11y Testing (Day 1-2)

- **Add Dependencies:** Install `axe-core` (or `jest-axe`) and `@testing-library/react` as devDependencies for the Node tests. Also install `jsdom` if not already included (though some testing libraries bring it in). Optionally, add `tsgo` or configure `tsc` for quick compilation of tests.

- **Node Test Script:** Create an NPM script, e.g., `"test:a11y": "node scripts/run-a11y-tests.js"`. This script can discover `*.a11y.test.tsx` files (via glob), compile them (using tsgo or esbuild), and execute them. As an interim, one could use a tool like Mocha or Vitest in Node just for these tests – but a lightweight custom runner might suffice.

- **First Axe Test:** Write an a11y test for a simple component (like a `<Button>` or a form input) and deliberately introduce a violation (e.g., remove an aria-label) to see that it catches it. Then fix the violation and see tests pass. This validates the Node axe pipeline.

- **Disable Incompatible Rules:** Configure the axe wrapper to disable `color-contrast` and other problematic rules globally for JSDOM. This can be done in a setup portion of the Node tests (for example, using `axe.configure` to turn off certain checks). Document these disabled rules clearly, referencing that Playwright will cover them.

#### Phase 3: Expand Coverage in Inner Loop (Week 1 ongoing)

- **Write Tests for Key Components:** Start adding tests (both Bun and a11y) for all crucial components in the codebase. Prioritize components that are reused often or have complex accessibility considerations (dialogs, menus, inputs, etc.). Leverage the patterns illustrated (render, axe scan, role/name assertions).

- **Enforce Query Convention:** Introduce the ESLint rules for Testing Library
  to ensure no `getByTestId` selectors slip in. Add this to the CI lint step.
  Communicate the guideline clearly: test as a user, not via implementation
  details.

- **Team Training:** Host a short workshop or provide documentation on how to
  write these new tests. Show examples of good patterns. This helps scale the
  effort as multiple developers contribute tests.

#### Phase 4: Playwright Setup (Week 2)

- **Install Playwright and Config:** Add Playwright test runner (`@playwright/test`) and run `npx playwright install` to get browser binaries. Create `playwright.config.ts` with proper settings: use a base URL (if running against a dev server or Storybook), configure timeouts, and set test directory (e.g., `tests/e2e`). Also enable trace on failure and screenshot on failure for debugging.

- **Axe in Playwright:** Import `@axe-core/playwright` in a test to ensure it
  works. Write a basic test that navigates to a page and runs an axe scan.
  This validates that the environment can do in-browser scans (and helps
  fine-tune any needed delays or wait-fors to stabilize the page).

- **Visual Baseline:** Write a simple visual test for a static page and
  generate the baseline screenshot. Commit this baseline image to the repo
  because reference snapshots are generally tracked over time. Ensure that
  small pixel differences do not cause noise by adjusting thresholds or
  screenshot options if needed (such as disabling antialiasing via CSS in
  test).

- **Accessibility Snapshots:** Implement the `toMatchAriaSnapshot` matcher.
  This might involve calling `page.accessibility.snapshot()` and doing a deep
  comparison with a stored object. Existing example implementations from the
  Playwright community can also be used if available. Start by snapshotting a
  simple component or page to test the flow (store file, compare on next
  run).

#### Phase 5: Full E2E Test Development (Week 2-3)

- **Implement Scenario Tests:** Begin writing tests for critical user flows: e.g., “user can navigate through main menu with keyboard,” “opening and closing modals manages focus correctly,” “form error messages are announced or present in DOM,” etc. Use the patterns from 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. These tests might require building out some test fixture data or using a staging environment if working with real backend – ensure they are deterministic.

- **Implement Visual & I18n Tests:** Add tests for visual snapshots of key
  pages in both themes, and for switching language as described. Mark these
  as either part of the main Playwright suite or a separate suite if they
  should run less frequently (Playwright can tag tests, for example with an
  `@visual` tag, to filter runs).

- **Parallelize where possible:** Playwright parallelizes by default; confirm
  that tests are isolated (avoid tests interfering with each other by using
  fresh page and context instances for each run, which Playwright does by
  default per test). Use test fixtures for different viewport sizes or
  locales to run those in parallel threads.

#### Phase 6: CI Integration (Week 3)

- **Set up CI jobs:** Modify the pipeline to include the three jobs (Bun
  tests, Node a11y, Playwright). Use caching where possible (cache
  `node_modules` or Playwright browsers for speed). If using GitHub Actions,
  ensure runners have the necessary dependencies (or use the official
  Playwright action).

- **Artifact & Reporting:** Configure each job to output results. For
  Bun/Node tests, a simple console output might suffice, but JUnit or HTML
  reports can also be emitted using tools like `bun test --reporter junit` or
  a custom format. For Playwright, enable the HTML report and artifacts
  (videos, traces on failure). Upload these in CI (Actions artifacts).

- **Failure Criteria:** Decide the threshold for failing. Likely any failing
  test fails the job. For axe violations, the suite naturally fails if any
  violations remain because the tests assert zero findings. An allow-list
  mechanism may be incorporated if there are legacy known issues (though
  fixing them remains preferable).

- **Notification:** Update PR template or guidelines to mention that a PR will not be merged if accessibility tests fail. Possibly integrate a status check that specifically surfaces “Accessibility Checks” vs “Unit Tests” so it’s clear where an issue lies.

#### Phase 7: Ongoing Maintenance and Coverage (Week 4+)

- **Backfill Tests:** Gradually increase coverage by adding tests for
  remaining components and pages. The goal is not 100% coverage for
  coverage’s sake, but rather coverage of all **accessibility aspects** of
  each element. Use the a11y test suite as a checklist for components – if a
  component has an interactive role, ensure it has at least one axe test
  verifying its basics.

- **Update Snapshots Intentionally:** When a legitimate UI change occurs,
  update the corresponding accessibility and visual snapshots. Treat these
  updates as code changes requiring review and double-check that the new
  output is correct.

- **Monitor Flakiness:** Keep an eye on E2E test stability. If a test is flaky (randomly failing), investigate and fix it promptly, as flaky tests can erode team trust in the suite. Playwright’s trace viewer can help debug intermittent failures. It might be a timing issue or a test that needs a slight adjustment (like waiting for an animation to finish).

- **Continuous Improvement:** As new accessibility best practices or tools
  emerge, integrate them. For example, if a library for detecting screen
  reader announcements becomes available, add tests for live region updates.
  If Bun adds support for JSDOM in the future, the Node harness could be
  simplified and axe could run directly in Bun, dropping the extra
  complexity. Remain adaptable to improve the framework.

By following this roadmap, the testing regimen grows incrementally and
robustly. Each phase delivers tangible benefits (immediate bug catching, new
coverage) without overwhelming the team. Within a few weeks, accessibility
testing moves from an abstract concern to an everyday part of development,
with contributors supported by quick feedback and protected by comprehensive
end-to-end checks.

### 5.2 Outcomes and Benefits

In conclusion, this accessibility-first testing architecture embeds the mantra
“**shift left** on accessibility” into the development lifecycle. Fast Bun
tests and Node axe checks mean issues are caught at the earliest possible
moment. Playwright E2E ensures that nothing slips through the cracks when it
comes to real user experience. Periodic manual audits or the diligence of
individual developers remembering every ARIA rule are no longer the only
safety net; the system provides continuous coverage.

**Key benefits:**

- **Higher Quality UIs:** Fewer accessibility bugs reach production, resulting in an inclusive product by default.

- **Developer Efficiency:** Quick inner loop tests prevent context-switching; developers fix issues while the code is fresh in mind. The outer loop, while slower, is automated and saves QA effort by catching issues that would be hard to find manually.

- **Documentation by Tests:** The tests themselves serve as living
  documentation of accessibility expectations. New team members can read
  tests to understand how components should behave (for example, “Modal
  should return focus to opener on close – see test X”). This knowledge
  sharing is invaluable.

- **Compliance and Confidence:** Conformance to standards (such as WCAG 2.1
  AA) can be asserted with confidence because automated checks cover many
  criteria (contrast, focus order, semantics, etc.). This mitigates risk from
  a legal/compliance standpoint and broadens user reach.

By modernizing the original design to use **Bun for speed** and a **Node
assist for axe**, the core philosophy is preserved: accessibility testing
should enhance, not hinder, development velocity. Every layer of testing
reinforces the others, and together they create a safety net where
accessibility regressions simply cannot survive unnoticed. This is the
essence of high-velocity, accessibility-first development – moving fast
**without breaking things** for users.
